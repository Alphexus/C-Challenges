# C Challenges
A collection of C challenges I've written categorized by difficulty. If you have any questions, contact me on Discord: CntKillMe#2648.
If there's an issue in any of the challenges (i.e. typo, misinformation, ambiguity, etc.) feel free to file an issue.

## Summary
It is expected you are sufficiently fluent in C. If you want, you may implement these projects in C++ and organize them using classes and other C++ language features but you will have to provide your own test cases.
All C99 **standard library** functions are fair game. No outside libraries or compiler extensions/intrinsics are allowed unless explicitly stated.
If you're solving the challenges in C++, refrain from using the C++ standard library if they essentially solve the problem for you.
